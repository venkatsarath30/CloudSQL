# CloudSQL

**1. Introduction to Cloud SQL**
- Overview of Cloud SQL as a managed relational database service
- Supported database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server[1][7][8]
- Key features and benefits (scalability, integration, managed backups, security)[1][7]

**2. Cloud SQL Architecture and Use Cases**
- Cloud SQL vs. other GCP storage technologies
- When to use Cloud SQL: production, development, analytics[5][7]

**3. Creating and Configuring Cloud SQL Instances**
- Provisioning a new Cloud SQL instance
- Instance settings: region, machine type, storage, backups[1][5]
- Understanding pricing models and billing[5][7]

**4. Connecting to Cloud SQL**
- Connection methods: Cloud Shell, gcloud CLI, SQL clients, private/public IP[5][7]
- Integrating with GCP services: App Engine, Compute Engine, GKE[7]

**5. Database Operations and Management**
- Creating databases and tables
- Importing and exporting data (CSV, SQL dump)[6]
- Running SQL queries: CREATE, INSERT, DELETE, UNION, etc.[6]

**6. High Availability and Replication**
- Configuring failover replicas for high availability
- Setting up read replicas for scaling reads
- Simulating failover and recovery[5][7]

**7. Backup, Recovery, and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**
- Automated and on-demand backups
- Enabling binary logging for PITR
- Restoring databases to previous states[7]

**8. Security and Access Control**
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Using customer-managed encryption keys
- Configuring network firewalls and private connectivity (VPC)[7]

**9. Monitoring, Logging, and Performance Tuning**
- Monitoring instance health and metrics (CPU, memory, storage, connections)[8]
- Setting up alerts for resource utilization
- Performance optimization strategies[8]

**10. Migration and Integration**
- Migrating data from on-premises or other cloud databases
- Using Cloud SQL with BigQuery for analytics[7]

**11. Best Practices and Troubleshooting**
- Cost optimization
- Maintenance and updates
- Common issues and solutions[5][7]
